/**
 * You are supposed to design an API and a backend for a system that can allot
 * phone numbers to people living in a city. The API should enable the clients
 * (people in the city) to do the following:
 *
 * When a client requests for a phone number, it allots one of the available
 * numbers to them. Some clients may want fancy numbers, so they can
 * specifically ask for a number to be alloted to them. If the requested number
 * is available then the system allots it to them, otherwise the system allots
 * any available number.
 *
 * The system need not have to know which number is alloted to which client. The
 * same client may make successive requests and get multiple phone numbers for
 * himself, but the system is not bothered. At any point of time, the system
 * only knows which phone numbers are alloted and which phone numbers are free.
 *
 * To be very specific, the phone number allotter class should implement the
 * PhoneNumberAllotter interface below.

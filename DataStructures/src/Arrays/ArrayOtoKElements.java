/**
 * Write a class that given an array of N integers with values in the range 0 to
 * K, pre-processes its input and then answers any query about how many of the N
 * integers fall into a range [A,B] in O(1) time (note: the range includes A and
 * B). Your algorithm can use no more than O(N + K) pre-preocessing time.
 *
 * Your class: Answer0toKRangeQuery should implement a constructor with the
 * following signature. The constructor should take as input the array to be
 * processed, and the value K which determines the range 0 to K.
 *
 *    Answer0toKRangeQuery(int[] array, int k)  {...}
 *
 * Your class should also implement the method:
 *
 *    int countNumIntegers(int rangeStart, int rangeEnd)  {...}
 *
 * The above method answers the required queries in O(1) time.
